Here are some of the problems I encountered when I was installing Flutter:
1. Path variable configuration: Improper setup of the PATH environment variable for the Flutter SDK and Android tools led to issues.
2. Environmental variable configuration: Errors occur when configuring environmental variables for Flutter and Android tools.
3. Flutter plugin installation: Problems occur during the installation of the Flutter plugin for VS Code.
